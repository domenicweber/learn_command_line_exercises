So I went through all the different manuals and still, programmers are terrible teachers...no offense to my teachers.  
But yea, they aren't very good descriptions of what they commands to.

1) Maybe it would help if we knew what an argument was...
xargs reads strings (kinda know what those are) and executes utility?  Poor guy why did they execute him



2) chmod: modifies "File mode bits"....like I know what those are.  And "Mode" operand...again, what?

I'm guessing from reading "MODES" this has to do with what one can do with a file. EG read it or write to it, execute it, etc

Modifying ACL, ok, I get that.




3) chown: changes user or group ID, why, who cares?



4) Sudo, I get, but again, I don't know when I would be using this.
