In the /chapter_13/tmp I used `touch database.yml` then I used `open database.yml` Which opened the file in Textwrangler, which is fine.  I then copy pasted old command lines.  
Using `cat database.yml` just make yous fly through it and you really can see everything until you mouse scroll back up

> What is in your Gemfile?

Same process as above: `touch Gemfile` then `open Gemfile` this one just opened in txt edit.  
Then I wrote a love song so when I type `cat Gemfile` it shows my little song on the screen, however my computer is terrible at signing.
