> How big are is foo.txt?

Not sure what this has to do with the chapter but I used `ls -lh foo.txt` to see how many bytes the file is


> Can you output all the txt files in this directory?

To show all the txt files use `ls *.txt` meaning ANY file ending in .txt


> Show me the content of the text files in slash temp.

If I were in the /chapter_16 directory I could type `ls tmp/*` note that if you type `ls tmp/*.*` it will only show you files with extensions.  Not everything.
