> What option to ls tells it to output file size in human readable form?

This is an extrodinarily vague question...If you use `ls -lh` you will get a file that shows the size in the most convient format based upon the file size

>Is there a case insensitive option to grep?

Yes there is, if you use `grep -i` it will disreguard letter case


> What does the -r and -f options to rm do exactly?

I think -f stands for "eff that" meaning it will not prompt you if you REALLY want to remove something irregardlessly (yes I know that's not a real word) of permissions
 
What does -r do, the same as -R.  Seriously, I'm saying this b/c the description is the dumbest way of phrasing something possible.  

Why can't programmers speak English?  If you can answer me that you get 10 points.

My best understanding (as Google doesn't turn up anything) is that -R or -r will get rid of 

all the directories needed to get to a specific file you are trying to remove.  So if your file is 5 directories deep

and you `rm` it, it will remove all the directories up to that point as well.

>What does the ifconfig command do?

Assigns a network address to an interface system

Is this the same is ipconfig in DOS?  As a CCNA person I know this forwards and back.
