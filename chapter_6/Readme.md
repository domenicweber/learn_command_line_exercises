> What does -iR do?

###UPDATED

`ls` means you list the contents in a directory and the `l` stands for long format giving me permissions, time stamps, size of files etc.  When used with

the `R` it shows me everything recursively, meaning everything inside everything so that it lists all the subdirectories as far deep as they go.


> What's in the tmp directory?

In the chapter 6 directory I type  `ls tmp` and my computer says "stuff"


> Can you show me what files are in that directory?

I could alternately used `cd tmp` then `ls` go to the tmp directory and then look inside


> What files are in your home directory?

###Update

If I type `cd ` with nothing else it will bring me to my home directory, from here I just type `ls` to see what's inside.  I could also type `ls ~` from anywhere and see the same thing.

> What's in slash temp? 

From anywhere I can type `ls /tmp` and I get a ton of stuff.  Some very long hexadecimal looking number and other stuff and a log directory.  Note I did copy/paste this next portion as I wasn't gonna try to rewrite it!
