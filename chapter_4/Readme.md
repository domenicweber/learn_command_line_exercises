> Can you make a temp directory?

Sure I can...OHHHH, you want me to actually tell you how. OK, well the `mk dir` command will make a directory.  You don't have to be in a sub directory to make a deeper level sub directory either. I could be in `thoth/workspace/` and make a sub directory several levels down by typing `mk dir thoth/workspace/dog/cat/camel/cow` *provided* the dog, cat and camel directories already exist, if they don't I'll get an error that says "No such file or directory"
> Can you make a log directory in your class directory?

Again, yes...I think.  I used `mk dir workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2015/in_class/log` from my user directory `user/thoth` if that is what you are asking.  If not, I will simply repond with "Does not compute"
