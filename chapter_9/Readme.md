> Can you touch blah.txt?

In my chapter_9 directory I typed `touch blah.txt` and voila, a new text file is there when I type `ls`


> Let's create foo.txt.

In the same chapter_9 directory I typed `touch foo.txt` and wouldn't you know it the same thing happened again.

> Touch an existing file


####Update

If you run `touch -l <filename>` and the file already exists you will update
the file with a new time stamp.  I would not consider this an overwrite as it doesn't change anything inside the file

It's not really an error in the "bash" sense.  I made a directory called goaway and put a built a file using `touch nooo.txt` and it built the file.
I then backed out and tried `rmdir goaway` and it says "Directory not empty"
